Just go to Nikolskaya and you`ll see crowds of tourists, turn on the TV and you`ll see the exciting matches. I believe that this huge event has cheered up the whole nation.\nWhat I will remember the most? First of all I will remember the game England \u2013 Tunisia \u2013 that was my first experience of watching football at the stadium, attending the world scale event. Though I`m not a big football fan. I`m as they say \u201cKuzmich\u201d, glory hunter, I root for the winners, know only popular names, remember only the most impressive moments, but still I watch it every European championship and each World Cup.\nI will remember Volgograd being center of the world. I saw it previously asleep as any Russia`s provincial town, and I saw it awake. I met in one day journalists from all over the world: the Guardian, the Telegraph, the SkyNews, the Fox, the MatchTV. All in one place, in one pub exactly. I talked to friendly fans from different countries. I saw those enormous efforts and brilliant organization of everything.\nI will remember the play of our Russian team. Finally they didn`t disappoint their fans. After they beat Spain I went to Nikolskaya street and felt the joy of the crowd from inside.\nI actually felt pride for my country for the way everything was organized and how our team played.\nBut what I will remember the most is the day when with Eduard Vidostudio we went to Nikolskaya just to talk to people from all over the world and film some interview. It was the 26th of June, the middle of the championship. And we met different people: from USA, Mexico, Columbia, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Denmark, Serbia, Guatemala, Saudi Arabia. And the conversations were so kind and sincere. Everybody was so opened. We planned to make a short video for youtube, but it appeared to me impossible. I can cut myself, my questions, my phrases, my face, but I can`t cut the words of fans, people who were so nice to us. Eduard did his version earlier, you can watch it here https://youtu.be/Jjt7YbXk8SA with translation (I was a little ill and the voice got tired in the middle of it).\nBut I thought that it should have been done differently. So I did my own edition in English (with Russian subtitles \u2013 they are still coming). By the end it is a whole film about what they liked here, what happened with them, how they managed to get here, how they find Russia, Moscow, other cities, organization, food, prices, people, what we can improve. It was the middle of the championship so it is quite interesting to watch what people forecasted: who would win.\nSo it is quite long (almost 1 hour), you`d better take a cup of something, relax in your chair and enjoy Farewell to World Cup 2018.

Nakapagdirek na siya noon ng isang indie film titled Of Sinners And Saints na siya rin ang bida at si Polo Ravales pero mas natutukan siya ng spotlight when he played the role of Liza Soberano\u2019s adoptive father sa ABS-CBN series na Dolce Amore.\nAyon kay Ruben, ang goal niya talaga noon kung bakit nagpunta ng Pilipinas ay para magdirek. Mas mura raw kasing gumawa ng pelikula dito kesa sa Italy.\n\u201cMy first aim is to direct only,\u201d simula niyang kuwento sa PUSH. \u201cBut before, I was an actor in Italy, theater actor. And I studied two years in an acting academy before starting to direct.\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t really push my acting here. I\u2019m just lucky that I won best actor in Of Sinners And Saints in 2015 World Premieres Film Festival-Philippines (ng FDCP, Film Development Council of the Philippines).\n\u201cAnd then, that year, ABS-CBN was looking for an Italian actor who could act in English, little Tagalog, so they were searching on the Internet if ever there was somebody but they didn\u2019t find anybody.\n\u201cWhen the project manager typed \u2018Italian Actor Philippines\u2019 in Google, they found me. But they don\u2019t have my number. Luckily, June Rufino had my number. So she gave my number to ABS-CBN and they called me,\u201d dire-diretso pa niyang kuwento sa PUSH.\nInamin ni Ruben na maraming magagandang bagay ang nagawa sa kanya ng Dolce Amore.\nAniya, \u201cI got the role in an international TV series, I got it because of Dolce Amore. Because the casting director knew me from Dolce Amore,\u201d pagmamalaki niya sabay pakiusap na huwag na muna naming isulat ang pangalan ng Hollywood action star na bida rito dahil bawal pa raw.\nPatuloy pa niya, \u201cDolce Amore is a blessing, really. Kasi Dolce Amore now is being aired abroad, in Malaysia. So I get a lot of following requests from Malaysian fans. Not only Pinoys living in Malaysia but also Malaysian. They love the teleserye.\u201d\nNabibigyan din daw siya ng mga role sa pelikula ng mga naging director niya sa Dolce Amore na sina Mae Cruz at Cathy Garcia-Molina.\n\u201cI also got a small role in Can\u2019t Help Falling In Love, in Unexpectedly Yours. Pero minsan, wala talagang role na bagay sa akin,\u201d sabi ulit ni Ruben.\nSamantala, hindi itinanggi ni Ruben na nami-miss niyang katrabaho ang LizQuen.\n\u201cI\u2019m not part of their new teleserye, yung Bagani. Pero, yeah, nami-miss ko sila makatrabaho ulit, yung LizQuen. Sana, sana next year magkaroon ulit ng project with them. Pero next year mayroon akong mga project sa Italy, so I hope they don\u2019t call me when I\u2019m busy sa Italy,\u201d natatawa niyang pahayag.\n\u201cActually I have a\u2026 I\u2019m attached to a firm in the US as a director, but still it\u2019s in a developing stage. So I have to go to US also as a director,\u201d susog niya.\nIbinalita rin ng Fil-Italian director na meron siyang bagong pelikula.\n\u201cMeron akong isang bagong movie, The Spider\u2019s Men. Meaning the men of spiders. Kasama ko sa movie sina Richard Quan, Lee O\u2019Brian, Jeffrey Tam the magician, Rob Sy. It\u2019s a black comedy na ako rin ang nagdirek, nag-produce at sumulat.\n\u201cAng tema is I will reconnect with my half-Pinoy brother. Pero may sakit siya, autistic siya (Richard). Comedy na may drama rin and there\u2019s thriller, because some guys, they try to take advantage of me and my brother. It will be bloody. Actually, parang Quentin Tarantino style,\u201d paliwanag niya sa concept ng movie.\nBukod dito ay bida rin siya sa pelikulang The Lease kasama si Garie Concepcion na tungkol naman sa paranormal thriller.\n\" Continue: http://push.abs-cbn.com/\u2026/exclusive-fil-italian-actor-direc\u2026\nSee Translation"}, "Comments": "4 Comments"}, {"Date": "1521211325", "Name": "Auguzteno is watching Mudras Calling.", "Shares": "243 Shares", "Like": "1K", "Post": {"Link": ["https://scontent.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/29261673_860186070848085_56530277945573376_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&oh=a4b070a5c2c4b55f93b0cf6a7cb6748c&oe=5C1861F4"], "Post": "Mudras Calling (non-spoiler review)\nBefore my review of MUDRAS CALLING, I would like to explain about my relation between me and Myanmar Films. It\u2019s been a pretty long time that I don\u2019t enjoy Myanmar films. I watched some but just couldn\u2019t enjoy. I have to admit that I expected some to be something different with typical films since they said that is not like the other typical film. You will see something special blah blah and I believed. But one after another, it keeps coming till I say goodbye forever to Myanmar film.\n\u201cDeception\u201d was a famous one. I could enjoy a bit but not at all (I don\u2019t compare \" Deception \" with other typical films. IF SO, D IS Already ON WHOLE NEW LEVEL ) Now KYI Couple who is the creator of \u201c Deception \u201c introduces us a Film, MUDRAS CALLING. They created MUDRAS CALLING on 2014 and won several awards. But it couldn\u2019t be on theater until today. So it\u2019s been a 4 years already.\nThe film is about Jaden who was raised in US returns to Myanmar (his native) for his thesis on Myanmar music. He met Hnin who is graduated with art and currently running a tour agency. So Nu (Hnin\u2019s friend) and Hnin starts the tour with Jaden in order to help him for Thesis. During the tour, something they would never imagined are happened, and they found out about Jaden\u2019s past.\nThere are some weak points I found. Supporting character Nu lost her role. I have no idea why she is in the film. According to Myanmar society, two opposite sexes travel overnight is kinda unacceptable and that\u2019s the reason why Nu is with them. Even though, she has been disappeared almost all the time but Jaden checked his camera, and we could see the pictures of Nu and Hnin together. But not in the film. And on the bus (overnight) Jaden and Hnin are together and Nu is behind them. That\u2019s crazy. I think that is the worst mistake KYI ever made. And one more thing is in Inle. Jaden sits at the most behind of everyone. Others will think that\u2019s not a problem but for me, as a tour guide, I found that is weird. Jaden is guest anyway. And he even has the camera. He should be at the front of the boat.\nThe thing that impressed me much is background music I may be wrong but as far as I know, this is the first time we can see film with such kind of background music. Sometimes it is pretty loud. But it is not a big deal. Some may say Hnin and Nu\u2019s language is not good enough and Hnin focuses on her dialogue too much that could make her acting looks weird. But I think it should be. Their characters cannot speak English as natives since they are not raised in US. The view of Myanmar in the film is beautiful. But KYI didn\u2019t force her audiences to think Myanmar is awesome. Myanmar is pretty. Honest blah blah. She just show what Jaden see and that makes us more interesting, and we could still feel like we are watching film. Not a bird eye view of Myanmar.\nActings are not perfect. But still better than other typical actors. Even me as a drama blind, the family reunion scene makes me feel warm. They don\u2019t exaggerate. Only their eyes talk since there\u2019s a language difference. And it occurs to me that some supporting characters from typical films also have such a good acting skill and they just didn\u2019t have a chance to show. I saw a man from typical film. I don\u2019t even know his name. He plays an important role but only for a couple minute, and he didn\u2019t talk a lot. He played all by his eyes. It is completely different with him, we saw in earlier typical film. I wish KYI could make the boat departing scene little longer, that would be heart touching.\nAnd there are some romantic scenes but still in reality. There is an odd sounding word about typical film. It is \"watch a film as a film\". I can't agree. Unless the film is fiction like Harry Potter, it should not be so different with reality.\nI\u2019ve sick on forced acting of typical film. But in this MUDRAS CALLING, I could see what is called acting. It was so simple and romantic enough without roses, wine and of course weird background music.\nAs a conclusion, MUDRAS CALLING is not a perfect one. And also you won\u2019t like if you are a huge fan of extreme emotional acting and super mega ultra great great words those are too great to exist in real world. Please don\u2019t watch this otherwise you are just wasting your time.\nIf you love art, true creation and acting with passion, please enjoy. I highly recommend. If you ask my rating on MUDRAS CALLING., I will definitely say 9/10. I believe if they could make it as soon as it finished in 2014 that would have been better.\nI believe KYI Couple will be able to revolt the influences of earlier typical film and they let us show the world what Myanmar film is. It doesn\u2019t mean MUDRAS is good enough to win Oscar. But it is more than enough to show your foreign friends who would like to know about Myanmar film . At least it won\u2019t bring a shame. I expect more and more not only from KYI Couple also from the others. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to see good films only from KYI Couple. Hope others will also try to fix themselves instead of bashing.\nThank you so much KYI Couple for bringing such a quality one.\n#Teno\nPS. Comments with broken English are also welcomed.

ZDF shows his concert. He also enjoys the moment off stage.\nThe opera star is looking forward to his evening also because ZDF broadcasts Jonas Kaufmann's concert for a large audience on the Sunday after the next Sunday (July 15th, 10 pm), which the tenor is giving two days earlier in Berlin's Waldb\u00fchne.\nThe 48-year-old enjoys these days downright, where he stands on stage in the evening and can do what he wants during the day. When the weather is good, he can sail and does not need to worry about being called constantly. Nobody wanted to bother an artist shortly before the performance: \"Nobody dares to talk to me about schedule or anything like that.\"\nWith the ZDF concert he wants to \"refresh the old enthusiasm for Italy with the audience living on north of the Alps\". He sings, accompanied by an orchestra, Italian opera hits, including Verismo arie by Mascagni and Leoncavallo. It is a program of great culture that the former mathematics student tries to make palatable to the television audience.\nRebirth of the opera singer Enrico Caruso (1873-1921)\nIt is a heartfelt concern for Kaufmann, for whom Italy is a longing country. He grew up with this music, he calls his parents Italian. They laid the foundation for Kaufmann's world career. It has long been more than just a tenor: Many fans consider him a reincarnation of Enrico Caruso, the world-famous opera singer from Naples.\nThe notoriety of Kaufmann, who has sung in Milan, Paris, Brussels and Vienna, extends far beyond the classical world. At the final of the Champions League 2013, for example, he was on the side of pop violinist David Garrett a guest in front of tens of thousands football fans. He finds his Italian concert in Berlin something special. \"I like it when you feel an audience. I also do not know excactly what you feel but you can tell if people are there, if they drift off, if they need to do something, use a gimmick to get them back.\"\nTwo concerts with colourful opera program in Spain\nAs casually as the Munich native comes across in conversation with his elegant appearance and his gentle Bavarian language coloration, the tenor knows the dark side of the classical world. Most recently, he caused a sensation with an interview in which he reported how he had been sexually harassed at the beginning of his career when a manager offered him a concert if he went with him in the sauna. In addition, Kaufmann is constantly under pressure: from Berlin he travels to the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival.\nShortly thereafter, he sings Siegmund in Wagner's \"Valkyrie\" in Munich, then two concerts with a colourful opera program in Spain, then back to Munich for the conclusion of the opera festival. All this before the actual Summer break, which often means festival time for singers and musicians and therefore lot of work. Is this work healthy?\nThe father of three children is compensated by his family\nKaufmann says he is able to relax during working hours, and justifies this with his Italian socialization. \"It is part of the Dolce Vita that one understands the art of enjoying the moment. In this way you can enjoy ten minutes of free time. I do not need time to get down.\"\nA compensation for the father of three children is staying with his family. Or he likes to relax on his boat. Sometimes he also cleans the kitchen late at night to distract himself. \"You have to be there unconditionally,\" says Kaufmann, \"then you just get a little less sleep.\"\nReturn to the Homeland\nBecause he does not want to give it all up, he is glad to have finally arrived. Seven years ago he moved back to his hometown in Munich, he made the city his retreat. Meanwhile, he works at the Bayerische Staatsoper, where he is on stage with \"Parsifal\". He feels well in Munich, where he does not have to \"hide in the movies in the evening to forget that sometimes you are often alone in this job.\"\nIn London or New York, where the sought-after Wagner tenor leads many journeys, he sometimes feels lonely. These cities, he says, remained strangers to him. Not everything is perfect in Bavaria. But there he has other, lighter problems: \"In Munich, I have to coordinate the many contacts and sometimes go with people to drink the beer that I have long promised them.\"\n________________________________________________________________\nEnglish Summary Radio Interview: \"Translation by Laura Fontana - Summary ARD / rbb interview 2018-07-06 Vis \u00e1 vis\nPresenter asks about the difference between Opera house and Waldb\u00fchne: wheather Jonas Kaufmann is more relaxed at Open Air.\nJK: \"Although the event is different, even at such concerts the concentration must be the same, maybe a bit more in front of 20 000 persons. In 19th century Opera was a sort of Pop Music, similar to the music in 20 th century. Both parts must be presentent carefully, weather and atmosphere help. Connection to an audience at a place like Waldb\u00fchne is relaxed and free.\"\nPresenter mentiones the behaviour at Open Air, eating and drinking and moving around.\nAsks about the very big repertory and using often his voice.\nJK: \"Preparation is always the same. Careful use of the voice is important, also right timing and mix.\"\nPresenter: \"Difficult to be on the top?\"\nJK: \"Woderful to be successful, but also a burden to fulfill the expectations of audience and myself. To keep the level is hard work.\"\nPresenter: \"What`s about the High C?\"\nJK: \"The dark coloured voice has an ordinary depth and also still the high, until E, what means not only C. This tone is magical; more psychologically than physically. H is much easier, although only a half tone lower and less stressful. Identification with the role avoids permanent thinking on a coming C.\"\nPresenter: \"What can help to take C more easy? Can gestures help?\"\nJK: \"Only psycologigally gestures or movement can support; the vocal cords must do it too. Singing must be as easy as speaking.\"\nPresenter: \"How do you manage voice problems? You stated that you are well again after your stop.\"\nJK: \"Positive eperiences are important: on the other hand it is also important to stop in time if there is a problem with the voice, to avoid negative ones. Cancellations are always difficult. Start with Lohengrin was a bit more stressful, but it worked.\"\nPresenter: \"What are the dreams and plans?\"\nJK: \"Tristan, Tote Stadt, some Italian roles, Palestrina, perhaps the both Siegfrieds, and two or three more. Also a lot of concert programms.\"\nhttps://www.waz.de/\u2026/star-tenor-jonas-kaufmann-singt-italie\u2026"}, "Comments": "33 Comments"}, {"Date": "1535303576", "Name": "Sean Brokensha The Music Guru", "Shares": "1 Shares", "Like": "15", "Post": {"Link": ["https://external.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAI3aCT-S8ur-Bg&w=147&h=147&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FD__PKJ-4w-0%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1&upscale=1&fallback=news_d_placeholder_publisher_square&sx=305&sy=0&sw=720&sh=720&_nc_hash=AQC0x89keJ7tdLNw"], "Post": "ON THIS DAY\n1967, The Beatles held a press conference at University College in Bangor, North Wales with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

A. Wilson*\nThe quest for academic depth continues to dwindle among the current young generation. The clamour for mere certificates, diplomas and degrees has surpassed the passion for knowledge acquisition. As such it is now common to see people with decorated academic certificates yet cannot measure up to what is on those documents.\nI applaud the government for launching the free education drive. But I have the feeling that things will not change for the better if younger folks fail to do the needful. The pursuit for academic excellence and the ability to articulate and communicate well is not one that must be limited to the four corners of the classroom. How many of our graduates and undergraduates are making it a habit to keep glued to local and international news, read newspapers, magazines and books? My grandma of blessed memory, even at age 89 years, was a fan of newspapers, though not being a graduate. The willingness and genuineness to learn is what is our challenge. How many of these graduates have in their possession dictionaries, Brighter Grammar series and basic Mathematics text? Our shelves, tables and racks are filled with all other things, but not with a single book or dictionary. We spend thousands of leones in purchasing all the TV series, Naija Movies and SL Music. But not a dime a week on a Newspaper.\nThe speaking of our lingua franca (Krio) has become rampant even in English Language classes in our schools and universities. It is now a mockery to those who dare to communicate in English. You will be considered strange and pretentious. This has given rise to horrible pronunciation, arid vocabulary and poor use of tenses. You attempt to correct people, even in private and in the most subtle and humble fashion, they still will take offence and raise up a defence. You will hear words like; \" *Papa/Mama na u sabi. English nor to we language go England*.\" Very true, English is not our first language, but every educated Sierra Leonean is expected to write and speak it with a certain degree of proficiency. That besides, those very people who bash at others for being too \" *bookish/English*\" are the same people who cannot speak well their local language. Even Krio is quite another problem for people to speak with astuteness, talk less of English. They are neither here nor there. They aught to know that learning must not be confined just to the classroom. Let us do less with the fashion, cosmetics and football gossips/entertainment and do more in developing our intellect and skills.\nLet me end with one of my favourite quotes by John Dryden: \" *Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow; He who would search for pearls must dive below*.\""}, "Comments": "18 Comments"}, {"Date": "1534934669", "Name": "Kolimigundla Raja", "Shares": 0, "Like": "245", "Post": {"Link": ["https://scontent.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/39900526_2225688144320847_2898946888638136320_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&oh=7795f32f291c93c8234dc1e1cbc98db3&oe=5C286A84", "https://scontent.fphx1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p403x403/39894712_2225688200987508_120119188613234688_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&oh=ef1255d6a1a2f7fdbeb3eb45cb50454b&oe=5C55F545"], "Post": "First of all I would love to wish my beloved Annayya, \"Young Dynamic, daring and dashing, Supreme hero, and Mega Star\" Chiranjeevi, I wish you many many more happy returns returns of the day.\nI am working as an English lecturer, but you are my inspiration (Master film) and path.
